___
#### Purpose:
This project is designed to demonstrate my knowledge and skill with object-oriented
javascript programming.  I was given a basic HTML5 game engine written in javascript,
bare-bone HTML and CSS files, careful notes on the purpose of the aforementioned files,
and basic game art assets.  Using these, I was tasked with creating a frogger-like game
within an HMTL5 canvas element.  The game logic and user experience were almost entirely
mine to create, and I expanded the game well beyond the minimum requirements of the
project.

This project took approximately 12 hours to complete.  The most challenging parts were
demystifying the game engine, learning how to accept and manage user input, and configuring
the collision function.
